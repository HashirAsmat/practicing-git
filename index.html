    <h1>This is feature 1 branch </h1>
    <h1>this is me practicing git and name of the directory has been changed , if i have different name for local directory in my PC to the remote repository on GitHub account , it does not matter , i can push my code into my remote repo because at the end i will write the username and Repo name anyway e.g git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git , gitbash is already connected to my github account through email , so username and repo name is required , .git hidden file that resides in my local directory will save screesnhot or history of my coding file and the codes in it , from time to time as i am making commits by using commands i-e to add the files for commit (git add .) and then commit it by using (git commit -m "Initial commit") in terminal , it will save the history of the coding files , we can make as many commits as we wants , the .git hidden file compare the latest commit with our current coding file and see if any changes are made if changes are made it show them into the vsCode my "M" with it i-e modified , we can make multiple commits (as commits is like screesnhot of code file and codes in it) in our local directory and we can then choose one of the commit (screenshot) and push it to out GitHub remote repo , so remember we make commits in our local directory then later we push it to GitHub remote repo...
    <h3>more features added! </h3>
        <br>
        <h4>this is the basic commands <br>
            git init
            git add README.md
            git commit -m "first commit"
            git branch -M main
            git remote add origin https://github.com/HashirAsmat/practicing-git.git
            git push -u origin main
            
        </h4>
        <h4>some times when u wrtie this command " git remote add origin https://github.com/HashirAsmat/practicing-git.git" <br>
        you get an Error i-e <br>
        error: remote origin already exists.

        <br>
        reason:
        First time when you wanna connect with your remote Repo , the .git hidden file makes and origin (connection) of your local dir and your remote Repo this usually happen when u are uploading your first commit changes to your remote repo, this connection (origin) is established only when you are doing it for the first time so at first time you would not get any error , But! once git has build the connection , when you are uploading the commit or pushing the commits for the second time , the connection (origin) already exist , git will give u that error. for the second time you dont need to write this command again -> git remote add origin https://github.com/HashirAsmat/practicing-git.git , But you can simple push the changes   -> git push -u origin main

    <p> error: remote origin already exists. <br>
    in Details: <br>
    When you first connect your local Git repository to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub), Git creates a remote connection named "origin." This connection includes the URL of the remote repository. <br>

    After this initial setup, you don't need to re-run the git remote add origin command because the "origin" remote is already configured. <br>

    When you want to push changes to the remote repository again, you can simply use git push -u origin main (or the appropriate branch name) to push your changes. The -u flag is used to set the upstream branch, making it easier to push changes in the future without specifying the remote and branch names each time. <br>

    In summary, the "remote origin already exists" error is a reminder that you've already configured the "origin" remote, and you don't need to add it again. You can directly push your changes using git push once the initial setup is complete.

    <p>
    in your PC you may have alot of projects that you have uploaded to gitHub , so when u do so it's obvious that each project repository will contain .git hidden file , and that particular hidden file (.git) stores information i-e the commits , track the changes , the connection of Local Repo (directory) with the remote Repo -> that connection is called Origin , <br>
     so remember each local repo will have a .git file that .git will store information related the commits history (git log) and it also store the connected of the that particular local repo with the remote repo , <br>
     so in conslusion each Project folder i-e local repo contain a .git file that will store the origion or connection of the local repo with the remote repo; so once u have pushed some commit in the past time to the GitHub , now the origin (connection) exist , no need to make origion otherwise it will give u an error.
