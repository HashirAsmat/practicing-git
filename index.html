    <h1>this is me practicing git and name of the directory has been changed , if i have different name for local directory in my PC to the remote repository on GitHub account , it does not matter , i can push my code into my remote repo because at the end i will write the username and Repo name anyway e.g git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git , gitbash is already connected to my github account through email , so username and repo name is required , .git hidden file that resides in my local directory will save screesnhot or history of my coding file and the codes in it , from time to time as i am making commits by using commands i-e to add the files for commit (git add .) and then commit it by using (git commit -m "Initial commit") in terminal , it will save the history of the coding files , we can make as many commits as we wants , the .git hidden file compare the latest commit with our current coding file and see if any changes are made if changes are made it show them into the vsCode my "M" with it i-e modified , we can make multiple commits (as commits is like screesnhot of code file and codes in it) in our local directory and we can then choose one of the commit (screenshot) and push it to out GitHub remote repo , so remember we make commits in our local directory then later we push it to GitHub remote repo...</h1>
